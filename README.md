# shopify-fall2022-challenge

Hello! First off, this was a super unique first-round interview experience and I just wanted to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it. I appreciate Shopify taking more of a "real-world" approach to the interview process and really getting a wholistic view of their applicants.

My application should be fairly simple to use. The inventory is used to initialize items that can then be sent to warehouses that you create. You are able to add and remove items, as well as edit the name and quantity of existing items in your unallocated inventory. I decided to use react purely because it's what I'm most comfortable with for frontend development.
